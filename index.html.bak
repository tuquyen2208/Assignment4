<h1>Must-visit places in Da Nang</h1>
 <img src="image/danang.jpg" width="1340" height="600">
<p>
<div class="a" >
<br>There’s plenty to do in this gorgeous coastal city. Here are some of its top attractions…</br></div>

<div class="b" style="letter-spacing: 0.5px;" "line-height: 1.5;" "padding-right: 10px;" "padding-left: 10px;">
<br>Thanks to its central location, vast stretches of beach, and variety of things to do, 
the coastal city of Da Nang has become something of a tourism hotspot.</br>
<br>The city, which lies halfway between Hanoi in the North and Ho Chi Minh in the South, is the fifth-largest in Vietnam, and the third most populated. 
It has an international airport and is a short drive away from Hoi An,
 making it a great spot for international tourists to stay a few days on a tour of the country. 
 Locals and ex-pats living in Vietnam also love this destination for its relaxed lifestyle, burgeoning food scene, and exciting nightlife. 
 Here are just some of the top places to go when you visit Da Nang.</br>

<font color="#9E0B0F"><br><br><br><b>THE BEAUTIFUL BEACHES</b></br></font>
<br>The best thing about Da Nang is its long and wide beach frontage stretching for kilometers from the Sơn Trà Peninsula to Hội An. 
All along are white-sand beaches that are quiet for large parts of the day. 
At the southern end, the main beaches are Non Nuoc, Pham Van Dong, My Khe, and My Anh. 
Of these, My Khe is the most popular. It gets busy just before sunset when locals flock to its soft sand and clear water to swim or play sports. 
There are many seafood restaurants and sky bars nearby, so you can go out for a sumptuous dinner or sunset cocktail directly after.</br>
<br><img class="hinh2" src="image/hinh2.jpg" width="730" height="500">

<font color="#9E0B0F"><br><br><b>SƠN TRÀ PENINSULA</b></br></font>
<br>When at any of these beaches, look left. You’ll see the beautiful white Lady Buddha statue on the hill. 
At 67m, the Goddess of Mercy is the tallest Buddha statue in the land. To see it up close, head out to the Linh Ung Pagoda at Sơn Trà Peninsula, 
a nature reserve about 10km north-east of the city. The Sơn Trà (Monkey) Mountain protects the city from approaching sea storms.
 A hike or ride to the top will reward you with stunning views. And you may even spot the endangered Pygathrix nemaeus (red-shanked douc) on the way up. 
 The verdant rainforest surrounding the mountain covers 4,000 hectares, making it a cool, lush alternative to the beach on hot days.</br>

<font color="#9E0B0F"><br><br><b>BÀ NÀ HILLS</b></br></font>
<br>For a family-friendly day outing, head to Bà Nà Hills. This hilltop resort in the Trường Sơn Mountains is a 40-minute drive to the west. 
It was first established as a resort by the French back in 1919. While most of the villas were destroyed during the war, the Debay Wine Cellar still remains. 
Purchase tickets to enter the hills in advance, to skip the queues. Your entry includes a round-tip on the impressive cable cars going up and down the mountain. Once there, there are lots to see and do at the themed, castle-like Sun World Amusement Park. Walk the flower gardens or French village; visit the Linh Ung temple; or play games at the amusement park.
Of course, many people go to take pictures of the famed Golden Bridge. 
This 150-meter-long architectural marvel features two gigantic concrete hands elegantly holding a shiny gold walkway. Impressive (and Insta-worthy) indeed.</br>

<br><br><img class="hinh2" src="image/banahills 2.jpg" width="730" height="700"></br>

<font color="#9E0B0F"><br><br><b>THE MARBLE MOUNTAINS</b></br></font>
<br>A shorter drive from the city, going towards Hội An, will take you to the Marble Mountains. 
These are a cluster of five limestone and marble mountains named after the five elements: Thuy (water); Moc (wood); Kim (metal); Hoa (fire); and Tho (earth). 
Take the many steps up to get to a series of sacred sites. Think atmospheric grottoes containing beautiful shrines and statues. 
Of course, the sea views are also spectacular. Once back on ground level, step into one of the souvenir shops below to buy a special keepsake.</br>

	In this one-time trading port, the Thu Bon River meanders past crumbling shop houses and weathered pagodas, 
	while sampans come and go from the old ferry quay. Outside the Old Town, two-lane roads slice through waving
	rice fields and emerge at a frothy coastline. 
	Stay a couple of days, and Hoi An's easygoing beauty and lantern-lit nights may leave you hopelessly beguiled.</i></h4>

	pagodas, art déco mansions, and eye-popping markets. Through the whole scene flows the Perfume River, setting a languid pace the rest of the city is 
	happy to follow.</i></h4>
